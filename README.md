Hello! I'm Riccardo Cappuzzo (@rcap107). I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Inria Saclay](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) and [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com). I am working on wrangling tabular data so that it can be used for Machine Learning tasks. 

I work mostly with Python and its data science libraries (Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn). 

I am interested in word embeddings, graph embeddings, graph neural networks and how they can be applied to data curation tasks. 

I have implemented [EmbDI](https://github.com/rcap107/embdi), a data integration system based on tabular embeddings.
