Hello! I'm Riccardo Cappuzzo (@rcap107). I am a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Saclay and Dataiku. I am working on methods for generating embedding representations of tabular data, and their use in prediction tasks. 

I work mostly with Python and its data science libraries (Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn). 

I am interested in word embeddings, graph embeddings, graph neural networks and how they can be applied to data curation tasks. 

I have implemented [EmbDI](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/cappuzzo/embdi), a data integration system based on tabular embeddings.
