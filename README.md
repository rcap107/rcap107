Hello! I'm Riccardo. 

I am a research engineer working on the [Skrub library](https://skrub-data.org/) at Inria Saclay. 

I am mostly interested in tabular data cleaning and processing, information retrieval, feature selection, and how to optimize machine learning tasks around that. I have also worked with word and graph embeddings, graph neural networks, and their application to data curation tasks. 

I work mostly with Python and its data science libraries (Polars, Pandas, scikit-learn, skrub, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn...). 

My main projects are:
- [EmbDI](https://github.com/rcap107/embdi)
- [YADL](https://github.com/rcap107/YADL)
- [Retrieve, Merge, Predict](https://github.com/rcap107/retrieve-merge-predict)
- [GRIMP](https://github.com/rcap107/GRIMP)

If you want to reach out, you may contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-cappuzzo/) or send me an email to `riccardo[dot]cappuzzo[at]protonmail[dot]me`.
