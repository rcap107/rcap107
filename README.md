Hello! I'm Riccardo Cappuzzo (@rcap107). I will soon be defending my PhD thesis in "Deep learning models for data curation".

I work mostly with Python and its data science libraries (Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy). 

I am interested in word embeddings, graph embeddings, graph neural networks and how they can be applied to data curation tasks. 

I have implemented [EmbDI](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/cappuzzo/embdi), a data integration system based on tabular embeddings.
